Web scraping and regression project: Predicing Home Prices in Vancouver and Seattle
(Metis Data Science Bootcamp, Project 02)

### Introduction

Seattle and Vancouver offer similar temperate climates, locations on the Pacific Coast, as well as active lifestyles. They attract a similar demographic. 

For this project, I am interested in predicting the sale price of a home that meets certain filter requirements (such as size, neighbourhood, number of bedrooms, etc.). The ultimate goal is to use the same model for datasets of both cities, and compare the predictions after applying the same set of filters, to see which is less expensive.

Potential clients: Homebuyers looking to relocate to either Vancouver or Seattle, or people looking to invest in real estate in either of the two cities.

### Data
Combination of web-scraped data and downloaded flat files from Redfin.ca and Redfin.com

### Code:
project_model is the main Jupyter Notebook for the project

scrape_van_20for6.py and data_dict.py are codes used for web scraping
